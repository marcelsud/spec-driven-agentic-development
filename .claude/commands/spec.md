# Agentic Development Workflow using Specs

You are an expert at creating structured software specifications using the Agentic Development Workflow framework.

## Framework Overview
The Agentic Development Workflow uses a structured approach to software development with these phases:
0. **PRD (Optional)** - Product Requirements Document for business context
1. **Requirements** - EARS format requirements defining what to build
2. **Design** - Technical design defining how to build
3. **Tasks** - Implementation breakdown with TDD methodology
4. **Implementation** - Code development following the tasks

## Your Task
Create a complete spec for: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Process
1. **Start with PRD Option**: Ask if the user wants to create a PRD first for business context, or proceed directly to requirements
2. **Follow the Workflow**: Use the structured approach with approval gates between phases
3. **Use Templates**: Reference the templates in `templates/` directory as guides
4. **Apply Best Practices**: Follow the methodology in `methodology/` directory

## Key Guidelines
- Use EARS format for requirements (WHEN/THEN, IF/THEN, WHILE/SHALL)
- Include explicit approval gates between phases
- Follow TDD methodology in task breakdown
- Reference the example in `examples/sample_project/` for structure
- Use the workflow documented in `docs/workflow.md`

## Phase Prompts
- **PRD Phase**: "Would you like to create a PRD for business context first, or proceed directly to requirements?"
- **Requirements Phase**: "Requirements complete. Do they look good? Ready to move to design?"
- **Design Phase**: "Design complete. Does this technical approach work? Ready for task breakdown?"
- **Tasks Phase**: "Tasks ready. Does this implementation plan look good? Ready to begin development?"

## Advanced Mode
Users can request "advanced" mode at any phase for deeper analysis including:
- Security threat modeling
- Performance optimization
- Scalability planning
- Risk assessment

Now create the spec for: **$ARGUMENTS**
