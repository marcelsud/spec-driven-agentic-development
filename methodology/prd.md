# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Guide

## Overview
A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a strategic document that defines the business context, market opportunity, and product vision before diving into technical implementation details. In the spec-driven agentic development workflow, PRDs serve as an optional foundational layer that provides business context for creating more targeted EARS requirements.

## When to Use PRDs

### Ideal Scenarios for PRD Creation
- **New Product Features**: When building features that impact business strategy
- **Market-Driven Development**: When market analysis and competitive positioning matter
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: When multiple stakeholders need to align on business objectives
- **Complex Features**: When technical implementation requires significant business context
- **Strategic Initiatives**: When features tie to broader business goals and metrics

### When to Skip PRDs
- **Simple Technical Features**: Basic CRUD operations or technical improvements
- **Internal Tools**: Developer tools or internal processes with clear requirements
- **Bug Fixes**: Issues with well-defined scope and impact
- **Prototyping**: When exploring technical feasibility over business value
- **Time-Sensitive**: When rapid development is prioritized over comprehensive planning

## PRD Structure and Components

### Executive Summary
- **Purpose**: High-level overview for stakeholders
- **Length**: 2-3 sentences maximum
- **Content**: Feature purpose, target users, expected impact
- **Audience**: Executives, product managers, project sponsors

### Problem Statement
- **Current State**: Existing situation and limitations
- **Target State**: Desired future state and improvements
- **Why Now**: Market timing and business drivers
- **Validation**: Data and research supporting the problem

### Market Analysis
- **Market Opportunity**: Size, growth potential, revenue impact
- **Competitive Analysis**: Direct and indirect competitors
- **User Research**: Personas, interviews, behavioral data
- **Differentiation**: Unique value proposition and competitive advantages

### Product Specifications
- **Core Features**: Primary functionality with priority levels
- **User Experience**: Personas, user journeys, interaction patterns
- **Technical Considerations**: Platform requirements, performance needs
- **Integration Points**: How it fits with existing systems

### Business Requirements
- **Success Metrics**: KPIs, targets, measurement methods
- **Revenue Impact**: Financial projections and ROI analysis
- **Resource Requirements**: Development, design, testing needs
- **Timeline**: Phased implementation and milestones

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: Implementation challenges and mitigation
- **Business Risks**: Market, financial, and operational risks
- **Market Risks**: Competition, timing, and adoption risks
- **Contingency Plans**: Alternative approaches and fallback options

## PRD to EARS Requirements Transition

### Extraction Process
1. **User Stories**: Convert personas and user journeys into "As a...I want...so that" format
2. **Feature Specifications**: Transform feature descriptions into EARS format requirements
3. **Success Metrics**: Use KPIs to define measurable acceptance criteria
4. **Technical Considerations**: Reference constraints and requirements in EARS format
5. **Business Context**: Ensure all PRD elements are reflected in structured requirements

### Mapping Guidelines
- **Business Goals** → **User Stories**: Translate business objectives into user value
- **Market Requirements** → **Functional Requirements**: Convert market needs into system behavior
- **Success Metrics** → **Acceptance Criteria**: Transform KPIs into testable conditions
- **Risk Mitigation** → **Error Handling**: Address risks through system requirements
- **Technical Constraints** → **Non-Functional Requirements**: Include performance, security, scalability

### Quality Checks
- **Completeness**: All PRD elements addressed in requirements
- **Consistency**: No conflicts between PRD and EARS requirements
- **Traceability**: Clear connection between business goals and technical requirements
- **Testability**: All requirements can be validated against PRD success metrics

## PRD Best Practices

### Content Guidelines
- **Be Specific**: Use concrete data and measurable outcomes
- **Stay Strategic**: Focus on business value and user impact
- **Include Evidence**: Support claims with research and data
- **Consider Feasibility**: Balance ambition with technical reality
- **Think Long-term**: Consider future implications and extensibility

### Collaboration Approach
- **Stakeholder Input**: Gather requirements from all relevant parties
- **User-Centered**: Ground decisions in user research and feedback
- **Iterative Refinement**: Expect multiple rounds of review and revision
- **Cross-Functional**: Include technical, business, and design perspectives
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of decisions and rationale

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Too Technical**: PRDs should focus on business context, not implementation details
- **Unrealistic Scope**: Avoid feature creep and unrealistic timelines
- **Missing Metrics**: Always include measurable success criteria
- **Poor Research**: Don't skip market analysis and user research
- **Stakeholder Misalignment**: Ensure all parties agree on objectives and scope

## Integration with Spec Workflow

### Phase 0: PRD Creation
1. **Initial Discussion**: Agent offers PRD creation option
2. **Scope Definition**: Determine PRD depth and focus areas
3. **Content Generation**: Agent creates PRD based on user input
4. **Stakeholder Review**: Gather feedback and iterate
5. **Final Approval**: Confirm PRD before proceeding to requirements

### Phase 1: Requirements Transition
1. **PRD Analysis**: Extract key elements for requirements
2. **User Story Creation**: Convert personas and journeys
3. **EARS Formatting**: Structure requirements using EARS syntax
4. **Validation**: Ensure alignment with PRD objectives
5. **Approval Process**: Confirm requirements reflect PRD intent

### Advanced Mode Integration
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Deeper market research and competitive analysis
- **Strategic Planning**: Comprehensive business case development
- **Risk Modeling**: Detailed risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Executive summary and resource planning
- **ROI Projections**: Financial modeling and business case validation

## PRD Template Usage

### Template Customization
- **Industry Adaptation**: Modify sections for specific industries
- **Complexity Scaling**: Adjust depth based on feature complexity
- **Stakeholder Focus**: Emphasize sections relevant to key stakeholders
- **Timeline Considerations**: Include appropriate level of detail for timeline
- **Resource Constraints**: Balance thoroughness with available resources

### Section Prioritization
- **High Priority**: Executive Summary, Problem Statement, Success Metrics
- **Medium Priority**: Market Analysis, Product Specifications, Risk Assessment
- **Low Priority**: Detailed appendices, extensive competitive analysis
- **Optional**: Technical specifications, detailed financial projections

## Measuring PRD Success

### Immediate Indicators
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Agreement on objectives and scope
- **Clear Requirements**: Smooth transition to EARS format
- **Reduced Ambiguity**: Fewer clarification requests during development
- **Focused Development**: Clear prioritization and decision-making

### Long-term Validation
- **Feature Success**: Achievement of defined success metrics
- **User Adoption**: Actual usage matches projections
- **Business Impact**: Revenue and strategic goals achieved
- **Development Efficiency**: Reduced rework and scope changes

## Tools and Resources

## Conclusion

PRDs serve as a powerful tool for aligning business strategy with technical implementation in the spec-driven agentic development workflow. When used appropriately, they provide essential context that leads to more focused requirements, better technical decisions, and higher feature success rates.

The key is knowing when to invest in PRD creation versus proceeding directly to EARS requirements. Consider the business impact, stakeholder complexity, and strategic importance of the feature to make this decision effectively.
