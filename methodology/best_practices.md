# Software Development Best Practices

## Overview
This document outlines key software development best practices that should guide the implementation of features throughout the spec workflow. These practices ensure code quality, maintainability, and long-term project success.

## Requirements Best Practices

### 1. Focus on User Value
- Keep requirements focused on business needs and user outcomes
- Use user stories to maintain perspective on end-user value
- Avoid technical implementation details in requirements
- Consider the "why" behind each requirement

### 2. Make Requirements Testable
- Use specific, measurable acceptance criteria
- Avoid vague language like "user-friendly" or "fast"
- Include quantitative metrics where possible
- Define clear success and failure conditions

### 3. Consider Edge Cases
- Include error handling and boundary conditions
- Address security concerns in requirements
- Consider performance requirements under load
- Plan for accessibility and internationalization needs

### 4. Maintain Traceability
- Link requirements to business objectives
- Ensure each requirement has clear acceptance criteria
- Track requirements through design and implementation
- Document requirement changes and rationale

## Design Best Practices

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Organize code into logical layers (presentation, business, data)
- Keep related functionality together
- Minimize dependencies between modules
- Use clear interfaces between components

### 2. Single Responsibility Principle
- Each class/module should have one reason to change
- Keep functions focused on a single task
- Avoid "god objects" that do too much
- Use composition over inheritance

### 3. API Design
- Design APIs to be intuitive and consistent
- Use RESTful principles for web APIs
- Provide clear error messages and HTTP status codes
- Version APIs to support backward compatibility

### 4. Database Design
- Normalize data to reduce redundancy
- Use appropriate data types and constraints
- Design for performance with proper indexing
- Consider data migration strategies

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use consistent coding standards and formatting
- Add comments for complex business logic only

### 2. Error Handling
- Use structured error handling (try/catch, result types)
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Fail fast and recover gracefully

### 3. Security
- Validate all inputs at system boundaries
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Never store sensitive data in plain text

### 4. Performance
- Optimize for readability first, then performance
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Monitor and measure performance metrics

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. Test-Driven Development
- Write tests before implementing functionality
- Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Use descriptive test names that explain behavior

### 2. Test Coverage
- Aim for high test coverage but focus on critical paths
- Test both happy path and error conditions
- Include integration tests for component interactions
- Use end-to-end tests for critical user workflows

### 3. Test Organization
- Organize tests to mirror source code structure
- Use setup and teardown methods appropriately
- Keep test data separate from test logic
- Use test doubles (mocks, stubs) judiciously

### 4. Continuous Testing
- Run tests automatically on code changes
- Include tests in the CI/CD pipeline
- Use fast unit tests for quick feedback
- Run slower integration tests on merges

## Version Control Best Practices

### 1. Commit Practices
- Make small, focused commits
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use conventional commit format when applicable
- Commit frequently to avoid large changesets

### 2. Branch Management
- Use feature branches for new development
- Keep main branch stable and deployable
- Use pull requests for code review
- Clean up merged branches regularly

### 3. Code Review
- Review all code before merging
- Focus on logic, security, and maintainability
- Provide constructive feedback
- Use automated tools to catch style issues

## Documentation Best Practices

### 1. Code Documentation
- Write documentation for public APIs
- Document complex algorithms and business rules
- Keep documentation close to the code
- Update documentation when code changes

### 2. Project Documentation
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Document setup and deployment procedures
- Create architectural decision records (ADRs)
- Document known issues and limitations

### 3. User Documentation
- Provide clear installation instructions
- Include usage examples and tutorials
- Document API endpoints with examples
- Keep user docs current with features

## Deployment Best Practices

### 1. Continuous Integration/Deployment
- Automate build and deployment processes
- Use infrastructure as code
- Deploy to staging environments first
- Implement blue-green or canary deployments

### 2. Environment Management
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Never hard-code environment values
- Use secrets management for sensitive data
- Maintain consistency across environments

### 3. Monitoring and Logging
- Implement comprehensive application logging
- Monitor system performance and availability
- Set up alerts for critical issues
- Use structured logging for better analysis

## Maintenance Best Practices

### 1. Code Refactoring
- Refactor regularly to improve code quality
- Remove dead code and unused dependencies
- Update deprecated APIs and libraries
- Maintain consistent coding standards

### 2. Technical Debt Management
- Track and prioritize technical debt
- Allocate time for addressing technical debt
- Document design decisions and trade-offs
- Consider long-term maintainability

### 3. Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Regularly audit for security vulnerabilities
- Use lock files for reproducible builds
- Minimize dependency count and complexity

## Team Collaboration Best Practices

### 1. Communication
- Use clear and consistent terminology
- Document decisions and reasoning
- Conduct regular team meetings and retrospectives
- Share knowledge through code reviews and pair programming

### 2. Knowledge Sharing
- Maintain team documentation and wikis
- Conduct code walkthroughs for complex features
- Create and share development guidelines
- Mentor junior team members

### 3. Process Improvement
- Regularly review and improve development processes
- Gather feedback from team members
- Experiment with new tools and techniques
- Measure and track team productivity metrics

## Quality Assurance Best Practices

### 1. Definition of Done
- Establish clear completion criteria
- Include testing, documentation, and review requirements

- Regularly review and update criteria

### 2. Quality Gates
- Implement automated quality checks
- Require code review approval before merge
- Ensure all tests pass before deployment
- Validate performance and security requirements

### 3. Continuous Improvement
- Conduct regular retrospectives
- Track quality metrics and trends
