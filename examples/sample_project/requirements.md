# Requirements: Task Management API

## Introduction
A RESTful API for managing tasks in a simple task management system. Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks, with each task having a title, description, status, and due date.

## User Stories and Requirements

### 1. Task Creation
**As a** user, **I want** to create new tasks with title, description, and due date, **so that** I can track my work and deadlines.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** a user submits a POST request to `/api/tasks` with valid task data **THEN** the system SHALL create a new task and return HTTP 201 with the created task
2. **WHEN** a user submits a POST request with missing required fields **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with validation error details
3. **WHEN** a user submits a POST request with invalid date format **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with specific format requirements

### 2. Task Retrieval
**As a** user, **I want** to retrieve my tasks, **so that** I can see what needs to be done.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** a user sends a GET request to `/api/tasks` **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 200 with all tasks for that user
2. **WHEN** a user sends a GET request to `/api/tasks/{id}` **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 200 with the specific task details
3. **WHEN** a user requests a non-existent task **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 404 with appropriate error message

### 3. Task Updates
**As a** user, **I want** to update existing tasks, **so that** I can modify details and track progress.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** a user sends a PUT request to `/api/tasks/{id}` with valid data **THEN** the system SHALL update the task and return HTTP 200 with updated task
2. **WHEN** a user attempts to update a non-existent task **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 404 with error message
3. **WHEN** a user sends invalid data in update request **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with validation errors

### 4. Task Deletion
**As a** user, **I want** to delete tasks, **so that** I can remove completed or cancelled tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** a user sends a DELETE request to `/api/tasks/{id}` **THEN** the system SHALL delete the task and return HTTP 204
2. **WHEN** a user attempts to delete a non-existent task **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 404 with error message
3. **WHEN** a task is successfully deleted **THEN** subsequent GET requests for that task SHALL return HTTP 404

## Technical Requirements

### 5. Performance Requirements
1. The system SHALL respond to API requests within 200 milliseconds under normal load
2. The system SHALL handle at least 100 concurrent requests without degradation
3. The system SHALL support pagination for task lists with configurable page size

### 6. Security Requirements
1. The system SHALL validate all input data to prevent injection attacks
2. The system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. The system SHALL log all API requests for monitoring and debugging

### 7. Data Integrity Requirements
1. The system SHALL ensure task IDs are unique and immutable
2. The system SHALL maintain referential integrity between users and tasks
3. The system SHALL validate date formats and ranges

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 8. Usability Requirements
1. The system SHALL provide clear, descriptive error messages for all validation failures
2. The system SHALL return consistent JSON response formats across all endpoints
3. The system SHALL include helpful HTTP status codes that match the operation result

### 9. Reliability Requirements
1. The system SHALL maintain 99.5% uptime during business hours
2. The system SHALL handle database connection failures gracefully
3. The system SHALL recover from temporary failures without data loss

## Edge Cases and Error Conditions

### 10. Boundary Conditions
1. **WHEN** a user has no tasks **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 200 with an empty array
2. **WHEN** task title exceeds 200 characters **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with length validation error
3. **WHEN** due date is in the past **THEN** the system SHALL accept but flag as overdue

### 11. Error Scenarios
1. **WHEN** database connection is unavailable **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 503 with retry information
2. **WHEN** request payload exceeds size limits **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 413 with size limit details
3. **WHEN** malformed JSON is submitted **THEN** the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with JSON parsing error

- [ ] API responses are consistently formatted
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly
- [ ] Performance requirements are met
