# Project Setup & API Specification

## Feature Description
Establish the foundation for a personal todo application by defining the OpenAPI specification and generating the initial Go backend structure using go-blueprint. Set up docker-compose for local development environment.

## Functional Requirements

### OpenAPI Specification
- The system SHALL define API endpoints for basic todo CRUD operations
- The system SHALL include endpoints: POST /api/todos, GET /api/todos, GET /api/todos/{id}, PUT /api/todos/{id}, PATCH /api/todos/{id}, DELETE /api/todos/{id}
- The system SHALL define todo model with fields: id, title, description, completed

### Go-blueprint Code Generation  
- The system SHALL generate Go backend using Gin framework and SQLite database
- WHEN go-blueprint is executed THEN the system SHALL create project structure with HTML template support

### Database Setup
- WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize SQLite database with todos table IF it doesn't exist
- The system SHALL store the database file in a Docker volume for persistence

### Docker & API Server
- WHEN docker-compose up is executed THEN the system SHALL start the API server on port 8080
- The system SHALL serve an HTML index page at root path that calls /api endpoints
- The system SHALL return mock todo data from all endpoints with proper HTTP status codes

### Documentation
- The system SHALL serve OpenAPI documentation at /docs endpoint

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL be ready to accept requests within 10 seconds
- The system SHALL respond to API requests within 1 second under normal load

### Development
- The system SHALL support hot-reload for development changes
- The system SHALL use sensible defaults for personal use (single user, local development)

### Error Handling
- The system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404, 500)
- The system SHALL provide meaningful error messages in JSON format
