## Implementation Options

### 1. **TDD Implementation** (Recommended)
- Follow strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle for each task
- Write failing tests before any implementation code
- Maintain green test suite throughout development
- Refactor continuously while preserving functionality

### 2. **Standard Implementation**
- Implement features first, add tests afterward
- Focus on functionality over test-first approach
- Suitable for rapid prototyping or proof of concepts
- May result in lower test coverage

### 3. **Self Implementation**
- Use task breakdown as implementation guide
- Developer works independently using specifications
- Tasks serve as checklist and acceptance criteria
- Suitable for experienced developers

### 4. **Collaborative Implementation**
- Mixed approach with AI assistance
- AI implements complex logic, developer handles integration
- Real-time collaboration on challenging components
- Good for learning and knowledge transfer
