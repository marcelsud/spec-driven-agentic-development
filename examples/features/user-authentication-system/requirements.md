# User Authentication System - Requirements

## Overview
This document defines the requirements for a comprehensive user authentication system using the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format.

## Functional Requirements

### User Registration
The system SHALL provide user registration functionality with email and password.

WHEN a user submits a registration form THEN the system SHALL validate the email format is correct.

WHEN a user submits a registration form THEN the system SHALL validate the password meets security requirements (minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character).

WHEN a user attempts to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Email already exists".

WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL send a verification email to the provided email address.

WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL create an inactive user account pending email verification.

### Email Verification
WHEN a user clicks a verification link THEN the system SHALL activate the user account within 2 seconds.

WHEN a user clicks an expired verification link THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide option to resend verification.

The system SHALL expire email verification links after 24 hours.

### User Login
The system SHALL provide user login functionality with email and password.

WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user within 1 second.

WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display a generic error message "Invalid email or password".

WHEN a user enters incorrect credentials three times THEN the system SHALL lock the account for 15 minutes.

WHEN a user attempts to login with an unverified account THEN the system SHALL display message "Please verify your email address".

### Session Management
WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session token.

The system SHALL expire user sessions after 24 hours of inactivity.

WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate the session token.

The system SHALL support concurrent sessions for the same user across multiple devices.

### Password Reset
The system SHALL provide password reset functionality via email.

WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send a reset link to the registered email address.

The system SHALL expire password reset links after 1 hour.

WHEN a user clicks a valid reset link THEN the system SHALL allow password change without current password verification.

WHEN a user successfully resets password THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing sessions for that user.

### User Profile Management
The system SHALL allow authenticated users to view their profile information.

The system SHALL allow authenticated users to update their email address with re-verification.

The system SHALL allow authenticated users to change their password with current password verification.

## Security Requirements

### Password Security
The system SHALL hash all passwords using bcrypt with minimum 12 salt rounds.

The system SHALL never store passwords in plain text.

The system SHALL never log or expose passwords in error messages or logs.

### Session Security
The system SHALL use cryptographically secure random tokens for sessions.

The system SHALL store session tokens securely with httpOnly and secure flags.

The system SHALL implement CSRF protection for all authenticated endpoints.

### Rate Limiting
The system SHALL limit login attempts to 5 per minute per IP address.

The system SHALL limit registration attempts to 3 per hour per IP address.

The system SHALL limit password reset requests to 3 per hour per email address.

### Data Protection
The system SHALL encrypt sensitive data at rest.

The system SHALL use HTTPS for all authentication-related communications.

The system SHALL comply with data protection requirements for user information.

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time
The system SHALL respond to authentication requests within 1 second under normal load.

The system SHALL respond to registration requests within 2 seconds under normal load.

### Availability
The system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours.

The system SHALL handle graceful degradation during high load periods.

## Usability Requirements

### Error Handling
WHEN any authentication error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages.

The system SHALL provide clear feedback for all user actions (success, error, loading states).

### Accessibility
The system SHALL comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

The system SHALL support keyboard navigation for all authentication flows.

## Integration Requirements

### API Design
The system SHALL provide RESTful API endpoints for all authentication operations.

The system SHALL return consistent JSON responses for all API endpoints.

The system SHALL implement proper HTTP status codes for all responses.

### Database Requirements
The system SHALL store user data in a relational database with proper indexing.

The system SHALL implement database constraints to ensure data integrity.

The system SHALL support database migrations for schema updates.

## Audit and Logging Requirements

### Security Logging
The system SHALL log all authentication attempts (success and failure).

The system SHALL log all password reset requests and completions.

The system SHALL log all account lockouts and unlocks.

WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL generate security alerts.

### Compliance Logging
The system SHALL maintain audit trails for all user data modifications.

The system SHALL retain logs for minimum 90 days for security analysis.

## Error Scenarios

### Network Failures
WHEN email service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue verification emails for retry.

WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message to users.

### Data Validation
WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with specific field information.

The system SHALL sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

### System Overload
WHEN system reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation with informative messages.
