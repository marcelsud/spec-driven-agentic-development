## Introduction
Brief description of the feature and its purpose.

## User Stories and Requirements

### 1. [Primary User Story]
**As a** [user role], **I want** [feature/functionality], **so that** [benefit/value].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** [trigger condition] **THEN** the system SHALL [specific behavior]
2. **IF** [condition] **THEN** the system SHALL [specific behavior]
3. **WHILE** [state] the system SHALL [specific behavior]

### 2. [Secondary User Story]
**As a** [user role], **I want** [feature/functionality], **so that** [benefit/value].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** [trigger condition] **THEN** the system SHALL [specific behavior]
2. **IF** [condition] **THEN** the system SHALL [specific behavior]

### 3. [Error Handling Story]
**As a** [user role], **I want** [error handling behavior], **so that** [benefit/value].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** [error condition] **THEN** the system SHALL [error response]
2. **IF** [invalid input] **THEN** the system SHALL [validation response]

2. **WHEN** maximum limit reached **THEN** the system SHALL prevent further actions

### 10. Error Scenarios
1. **WHEN** network connection fails **THEN** the system SHALL retry with backoff
2. **WHEN** invalid data submitted **THEN** the system SHALL provide specific error messages

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Performance requirements are satisfied
- [ ] Security requirements are implemented
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] User experience is intuitive

## Template Usage Notes
- Replace [bracketed placeholders] with actual values
- Use EARS format (WHEN/THEN, IF/THEN, WHILE) for all behavioral requirements
- Keep requirements focused on WHAT, not HOW
- Ensure each requirement is testable and specific
- Consider all user roles and edge cases
- Review with stakeholders before proceeding to design phase
