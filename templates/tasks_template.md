## Parallel Execution Opportunities
- Tasks 4-6 and 7-8 can be done in parallel if multiple developers
- Documentation (Task 17) can be started earlier and updated incrementally
- Deployment configuration (Task 18) can be prepared in parallel with development

## Template Usage Notes
- Replace [bracketed placeholders] with actual values
- Adjust task granularity based on team preferences
- Add or remove tasks based on specific feature requirements
- Ensure each task has clear, testable acceptance criteria
- Follow TDD cycle: Write Tests → Implement → Refactor
- Consider team capacity when planning task execution
- Update task dependencies based on actual implementation needs
