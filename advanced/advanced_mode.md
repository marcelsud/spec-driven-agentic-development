# Advanced Mode: Optional Spec Workflow Extensions

This document provides optional "Advanced Mode" capabilities that can be layered on top of the standard workflow described in workflow.md.

### Activating Advanced Mode
Users can access advanced mode at any approval gate by:
- Typing "advanced" in response to the agent's standard prompt.
- Requesting specific advanced features by name.

---

## Phase 1: Requirements Creation (Advanced)

### Agent Prompt
"Requirements document created with [X] requirements covering [key areas]. Would you like to review the EARS format compliance, add edge cases, or proceed to design? Type 'advanced' for detailed review options."

### Capabilities
- **EARS Format Validation**: Detailed compliance checking for requirement syntax.
- **Requirement Traceability Matrix**: Cross-reference requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria.
- **Edge Case Analysis**: Systematic identification of boundary conditions and error scenarios.
- **Stakeholder Impact Analysis**: Assessment of how requirements affect different user roles.
- **Compliance Mapping**: Alignment with regulatory or industry standards.

---

## Phase 2: Design Creation (Advanced)

### Agent Prompt
"Design document completed with [technology stack] addressing all [X] requirements. Would you like to review architecture trade-offs, security analysis, performance considerations, or proceed to tasks? Type 'advanced' for detailed design review."

### Capabilities
- **Architecture Alternatives Analysis**: Comparison of different technical approaches with trade-offs.
- **Security Threat Modeling**: Systematic security risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
- **Performance Bottleneck Identification**: Analysis of potential performance issues and optimization opportunities.
- **Scalability Planning**: Assessment of system growth capabilities and scaling strategies.
- **Technology Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of technology choices and their long-term implications.

## Phase 3: Tasks Creation (Advanced)

### Agent Prompt
"Implementation plan created with [X] tasks across [Y] phases. Would you like to review task dependencies, risk analysis, or proceed to implementation? Type 'advanced' for detailed task review."

### Capabilities
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Identification of task dependencies and project timeline bottlenecks.
- **Resource Allocation Planning**: Optimization of task assignment and parallel execution opportunities.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identification of implementation risks and mitigation strategies.
- **Quality Gate Definition**: Specification of completion criteria and acceptance testing.

### User Responses
- "advanced" → Show detailed task analysis options
- "Show critical path" → Display task dependency analysis
- "Risk assessment" → Identify implementation risks
- "Proceed" → Move to implementation approach selection

---

## Phase 4: Implementation (Advanced)

### Agent Prompt
"Implementation ready with TDD tasks. Would you like to configure test strategy, CI/CD pipeline, code quality gates, or proceed with standard TDD? Type 'advanced' for implementation configuration options."

### Capabilities
- **Custom Test Strategies**: Configuration of specialized testing approaches (integration, performance, security).
- **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**: Automated build, test, and deployment configuration.
- **Code Quality Gates**: Definition of quality metrics and automated enforcement.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Establishment of performance baselines and monitoring.
- **Security Testing Integration**: Automated security scanning and vulnerability assessment.
- **Test Coverage Analysis**, **Mutation Testing**.
- **Continuous Integration Feedback** and **Deployment Pipeline Integration**.

### User Responses
- "advanced" → Show implementation configuration options
- "Configure testing" → Set up custom test strategies
- "Setup CI/CD" → Configure deployment pipeline
- "Quality gates" → Define code quality requirements
- "Standard TDD" → Begin standard TDD implementation

## General Benefits of Advanced Mode
- **Deeper Analysis**: More thorough examination of each phase.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive identification and planning for potential issues.
- **Quality Assurance**: Higher standards for deliverables and implementation.
- **Professional Standards**: Alignment with enterprise development practices.
- **Learning Opportunities**: Educational insights into best practices and methodologies.
