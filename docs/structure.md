## Spec Structure
Spec files are located in `.ai/specs/[feature-name]/` directory and consist of three main documents:

### 1. requirements.md
- Contains the formal requirements using EARS format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- Structure:
  - Introduction section summarizing the feature
  - Hierarchical numbered requirements list
  - Each requirement contains:
    - User story in "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]" format
    - Numbered acceptance criteria using EARS format with WHEN/THEN and IF/THEN constructs
- Focus on what the system should do, not how it should do it
- Consider edge cases and error conditions
- Include user experience and technical constraints
- Define clear success criteria

### 2. design.md
- Contains the technical design and architecture that addresses how the requirements will be implemented

#### Required Sections:
1. **Architecture Overview**
   - High-level system architecture description
   - Technology stack selection with rationale
   - Architectural patterns and design principles used

2. **Data Model**
   - Database schema design with table definitions
   - Entity relationships and constraints
   - Data types and validation rules
   - Foreign key relationships and referential integrity

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Complete REST API specification
   - HTTP methods, URL patterns, and route definitions
   - Request/response payload examples in JSON format
   - HTTP status codes for success and error scenarios
   - Query parameters and path parameters

4. **Application Structure**
   - Directory and file organization
   - Module separation and responsibilities
   - Layer architecture (controllers, models, routes, middleware)
   - Configuration and utility modules

5. **Error Handling**
   - HTTP status code strategy
   - Error response format standardization
   - Global error handling approach
   - Validation error reporting

6. **Data Validation**
   - Input validation rules for each endpoint
   - Field-level validation constraints
   - Business rule validation
   - Schema definitions for request/response validation

#### Additional Sections (if prompted for advanced mode):

1. **Security Considerations**
   - Input sanitization and validation strategies
   - SQL injection and XSS prevention measures
   - Data protection and privacy considerations
   - Audit trail and logging for security

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Database optimization strategies (indexes, queries)
   - Caching strategies and cache invalidation
   - Connection pooling and resource management
   - Scalability considerations

3. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Application logging strategy
   - Audit logging requirements
   - Performance monitoring approach
   - Error tracking and alerting

#### Design Principles:
- Address all requirements from requirements.md
- Provide sufficient detail for implementation without being overly prescriptive
- Consider technical trade-offs and justify technology choices
- Include concrete examples (code snippets, JSON payloads, SQL schemas)
- Balance simplicity with extensibility
- Consider security, performance, and maintainability from the start

### 3. tasks.md
- Contains the implementation tasks broken down from the design into actionable, incremental work items

#### Required Structure:
1. **Individual Task Definitions**
   - Task number and descriptive title
   - Clear description of what needs to be accomplished
   - Specific acceptance criteria that define "done"
   - Dependencies on other tasks (if any)

2. **Implementation Phases**
   - Logical grouping of related tasks
   - Sequential phases that build upon each other
   - Clear phase objectives and deliverables

3. **Task Dependencies**
   - Explicit dependency mapping between tasks
   - Identification of tasks that can be done in parallel
   - Critical path analysis for project timeline

#### Task Definition Template:
```
## Task N: [Descriptive Title]
**Description:** [What needs to be accomplished]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [Specific, testable criteria]
- [Multiple criteria as needed]

**Dependencies:** [Other tasks that must be completed first]
```

#### TDD Task Integration:
- **Test-First Approach**: For each implementation task, include corresponding test tasks
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Structure tasks to follow TDD cycle
- **Test Task Pattern**: "Write tests for [component]" followed by "Implement [component] to pass tests"
- **Interleaved Structure**: Test tasks immediately precede implementation tasks
- **Refactor Tasks**: Include explicit refactoring tasks after green phase

#### Task Characteristics:
- **Actionable**: Each task should be something a developer can immediately start working on
- **Incremental**: Tasks should build upon each other and deliver value progressively
- **Testable**: Acceptance criteria should be verifiable and measurable
- **Appropriately Sized**: Tasks should be completable in a reasonable timeframe
- **Independent Where Possible**: Minimize dependencies to allow parallel work
- **Comprehensive**: All aspects of the design should be covered by tasks
- **TDD-Ready**: Tasks should naturally support test-driven development workflow

#### Implementation Ordering Principles:
- Foundation first (project setup, database, core models)
- Test setup and infrastructure early
- API layer second (endpoints and validation) with tests
- Integration and testing third (error handling, comprehensive tests)
- Documentation and deployment preparation last
- Consider critical path and team capacity when ordering
- **TDD Cycle**: For each component: Write Tests → Implement → Refactor → Move to Next Component
